# ICSI 410 Programming Assignments

In this course, we were assigned three programming projects.

Programming Assignment 1 required us to complete several methods in different classes to represent both relational and non-relational data in a database.

The classes for representing relational data were:
- RelationSchema
- Tuple
The classes for representing non-relational data were:
- CollectionSchema
- DataObject
